Hello and welcome to my website! This is Juliana, a Colombian biologist and ornithologist interested in understanding animal behavior, particularly in birds. Among the fascinating gamut of behaviors that birds can display, I am passionate about avian brood parasitism. Over the last years of my career, I have committed myself to study this behavior and learn about what is known of parasite birds that cheat by nature on other bird species.

My research interest is focused on:

  -  Evolution of eggshell coloration
  -  Host-parasite coevolution
  -  Visual and color perception
